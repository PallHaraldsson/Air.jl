# Air ##########################################################################

Functional collections and utilities for Julia as light as air.

## Description #################################################################
Air is a Julia library that aims to take advantage of Julia's builtin immutable
paradigms to provide a set of functional utilities. Air is currently heavily
under development and will be changing drastically in the foreseeable future.
Inspiration for Air's design is derived largely from paradigms in Clojure and
Scala.

### Plans

Note that most of the basic plans have already been implementted, but are
currently undergoing testing.

* Completed plans
  * None
* Plans that are implemented but requiier testing
  * Persistent data structures:
    * `PArray`, a persistent array type that mimics Julia's native `Array`
    * `PDict`, a persistent dictionary type that mimics Julia's native `Dict`
    * `PSet`, a persistent set type.
    * `LazyDict`, a persistent lazy dictionary type.
  * Multi-threading utilities, inspired by Clojure
    * Thread-safe `Delay` and `Promise` types.
    * Thread-local `Var` type.
    * A `Volatile` type that operates with the `@tx` macro to ensure
      that all updates to references within a synchronized block are performed
      atomically.
    * An `Actor` type for sending asynchronous jobs to independent threads which
      also respects the atomic requirements of transactional `tx` blocks.
    * A `Source` type for safely reading from inputs such as sockets or files
      while respecting the syncronization of transactional `tx` blocks.
* Plans that are not yet implemented
  * **Persistent Record Types.** Tool for defining data structures that
    support lazy reification of members.
  * Trransient types
    * `PDict` should be O(1)-time convertable into the transient `TDict`
      type that can be updated without copying memory and that can be 
      converted into a persistent equivalent very quickly.
    * `PArray` and `TArray` should have a similar relationship.
  * `ChannelSourceKernel` type that creates a source kernel that pops values
    from a channel.
  * Better query/build/update API tools?
