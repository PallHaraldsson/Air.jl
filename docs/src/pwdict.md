# Persistent Weighted Dictionaries

`Air` supports, in additon to the standard persistent dictionary type
[`PDict`](pdict.md), a weighted dictionary `PWDict` (and `PWIdDict`). These types
are broadly similar to `PDict` and `PIdDict` except that their entries
additionally have non-negative numeric weights. These dictoinaries act as (1)
dictionaries, (2) priority queues, and (3) discrete random variables.

## Examples

In progress.
