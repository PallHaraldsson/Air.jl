# Persistent Weighted Sets

`Air` supports, in additon to the standard persistent set type
[`PSet`](pset.md), a weighted set `PWSet` (and `PWIdSet`). These types are
broadly similar to `PSet` and `PIdSet` except that their entries additionally
have non-negative numeric weights. These sets act as (1) persistent sets, (2)
priority queues, and (3) discrete random variables.

## Examples

In progress.
